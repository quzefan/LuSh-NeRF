# LuSh-NeRF
[NeurIPS 2024] The official implementation of the Paper: ["LuSh-NeRF: Lighting up and Sharpening NeRFs for Low-light Scenes"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06757)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

```bash
conda create -n lushnerf
conda activate lushnerf
git clone https://github.com/quzefan/LuSh-NeRF
cd LuSh-NeRF
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Please get the GIM pretrained model [gim_dkm_100h.ckpt](https://github.com/xuelunshen/gim) and put it in the ```./gim/weights``` folder.

## üóÇÔ∏è Data Preparing

#### For our data:

You can find our data at [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ubXiTRAjwhJ0zD7IXFdqBz88UaDjD0rJ?usp=drive_link). Please put the ```LOL-BlurNeRF``` folder in the ```./data``` folder.

The ```images```, ```images_1_preprocess```, ```HL``` (Synthetic Only) folder in each scene contain the original, preprocess and GT images.

#### For your own data:

Please make sure your data is in ```LLFF``` format and put it in the ./data folder.


## üöù Training

For example, to train `Poster` scene, 
```
python run_lushnerf.py --config ./configs/poster_lushnerf 
```
The training and tensorboard results will be save in `<basedir>/<expname>`.

When you training on your own data, please modify the ```scaleup-gamma``` and the ```scaleup-clahe``` hyper-parameters to make sure the images in the ```images_1_preprocess``` have a satisfactory color distribution.

## üñåÔ∏è Rendering
For example, to render `Poster` scene, 
```
python run_lushnerf.py --config ./configs/poster_lushnerf --render_only --render_radius_scale 2.0
```

## Note

#### Training Speed

Since our method need to optimize mutiple MLP network, it's training speed may be a bit slow. If your GPU memory is not sufficient or need a quick test, you can lower the ```N_samples``` and ```N_importance``` (64 to 32).
